Things to improve on:

UI

Working on asking more relevant questions to the team. After I built this app I realized that although the requirements may have seemed clear to me in the beginning, I realized that the end product may not be exactly what was in the team's minds. If I were to join the team I would mark certain milestones within the project, and check in with the team to see if it meets their expectations.

Adding the same repetitive POST type requests to the comments just like how i did with the ticket post and ticket delete. Felt that it was a bit repetitive and I can easily do it later.
