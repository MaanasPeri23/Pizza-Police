Things to improve on:

Working on asking more relevant questions to the team. After I built this app I realized that although the requirements may have seemed clear to me in the beginning, I realized that the end product may not be exactly what was in the team's minds. If I were to join the team I would mark certain milestones within the project, and check in with the team to see if it meets their expectations.
